Project: The pianica is a small wind instrument that uses a set of keyboard keys spanning approximately three octaves. It is played by blowing air through a mouthpiece to produce sound. With the advancement of technology, various methods for recognizing pianica notes have emerged, including artificial neural networks, one of which is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This research aims to design a note recognition system for the pianica with minimal input yet optimal performance using a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN). The system is intended to support music learning for students and teachers, equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance usability. The system is capable of recognizing eight basic musical notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and high C. The method involves pre-processing stages of the recorded audio signal, which is then processed by the one-dimensional CNN. The system was trained using audio recordings in WAV format, with 30 samples per note. From these, 20 samples were used for training and 10 for testing, using a model developed in the python environment with the tensorflow library. The results show that the system performs efficiently and accurately with an optimal minimal configuration, consisting of 16 inputs to the flatten layer, 30 epochs, 16 neurons in the fully connected layer, and a batch size of 2. With this configuration, the system achieved a real-time note recognition accuracy of 91.25%. These findings demonstrate that a 1D CNN-based note recognition system can be implemented in a minimal but optimal manner to detect pianica notes.
